                    What is Generative AI?
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. Generative AI was introduced in the 1960s in chatbots. Generative AI or generative artificial intelligence refers to the use of AI to create new content, like text, images, music, audio, and videos.

                <div  class="paragraph">
                    Generative AI is powered by foundation models (large AI models) that can multi-task and perform out-of-the-box tasks, including summarization, Q&A, classification, and more. Plus, with minimal training required, foundation models can be adapted for targeted use cases with very little example data.

                <div class="heading1">
                    How does Generative AI works?
                </div>
                <div  class="paragraph">
                    Generative AI models use neural networks to identify the patterns and structures within existing data to generate new and original content.
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    One of the breakthroughs with generative AI models is the ability to leverage different learning approaches, including unsupervised or semi-supervised learning for training. This has given organizations the ability to more easily and quickly leverage a large amount of unlabeled data to create foundation models. As the name suggests, foundation models can be used as a base for AI systems that can perform multiple tasks. 
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    Examples of foundation models include GPT-3 and Stable Diffusion, which allow users to leverage the power of language. For example, popular applications like ChatGPT, which draws from GPT-3, allow users to generate an essay based on a short text request. On the other hand, Stable Diffusion allows users to generate photorealistic images given a text input.

                    How to Evaluate Generative AI Model?
                </div>

                <div class="paragraph">
                    ˇThe three key requirements of a successful generative AI model are:  <br><br>
Quality: Especially for applications that interact directly with users, having high-quality generation outputs is key. For example, in speech generation, poor speech quality is difficult to understand. Similarly, in image generation, the desired outputs should be visually indistinguishable from natural images.<br><br>
Diversity: A good generative model captures the minority modes in its data distribution without sacrificing generation quality. This helps reduce undesired biases in the learned models.<br><br>
Speed: Many interactive applications require fast generation, such as real-time image editing to allow use in content creation workflows.

                    What are the Applications of Generative AI?
                </div>
                <div class="paragraph">
                    Generative AI is a powerful tool for streamlining the workflow of creatives, engineers, researchers, scientists, and more. The use cases and possibilities span all industries and individuals.

                <div class="paragraph">
                    Generative AI models can take inputs such as text, image, audio, video, and code and generate new content into any of the modalities mentioned. For example, it can turn text inputs into an image, turn an image into a song, or turn video into text.
